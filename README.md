# Full-Stack Todo Application with Authentication

This is a **Full-Stack Todo Application** built using **Next.js**, **Prisma ORM**, **PostgreSQL**, **NextAuth** for authentication, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **ShadCN UI** for UI components. The application allows users to sign up or log in using Google OAuth or their credentials, view and manage their Todo tasks, and edit or delete tasks in real-time. It is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can sign in or register using Google OAuth or their own credentials (email/password).
- **Todo CRUD**: Users can:
  - Add new tasks to their Todo list.
  - Edit and update tasks.
  - Delete tasks, with real-time updates in the UI.
- **Protected Routes**: The dashboard and edit page are protected, requiring user authentication.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is fully responsive and works on all device types (mobile, tablet, laptop, desktop).
- **Real-time Updates**: Adding, editing, and deleting tasks reflect immediately without a page refresh.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth (Google OAuth & Credentials)
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Deployment**: Netlify, Vercel, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

---

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/)
- PostgreSQL database (Local or hosted, e.g., [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres))

---

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
https://github.com/thehamzaataj/Next_Auth_Todo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
npm install
```
```
npm run dev
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/todo_db?schema=public"
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

Replace the following placeholders:
- `username` and `password`: Your PostgreSQL credentials.
- `todo_db`: The name of your PostgreSQL database.
- `your_random_secret`: A random string for session encryption.
- `your_google_client_id` and `your_google_client_secret`: Get these by setting up a Google OAuth 2.0 app in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

### 4. Run Prisma Migrations

After configuring the environment variables, run the following commands to set up your database schema using Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
npx prisma generate
```

This will set up your PostgreSQL database and generate the Prisma client.

---

## Authentication

This application supports **Google OAuth** and **credentials-based authentication** via **NextAuth**.

- **Google Authentication**: Sign in with your Google account.
- **Credentials Authentication**: Sign in using your email and password.

The authentication provider is set up in the `pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts` file.

---

## Database Configuration

The database uses **Prisma ORM** to interact with a **PostgreSQL** database. The `prisma/schema.prisma` file contains the schema for the `User` and `ToDo` models.

Run the following command to apply migrations and generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

---

## API Routes

The following API routes are defined for CRUD operations:

### 1. **/api/auth/[...nextauth]**
Handles authentication using NextAuth.js, supporting Google OAuth and credentials.

### 2. **/api/todos**
- **GET**: Fetches all todos for the authenticated user.
- **POST**: Creates a new todo for the authenticated user.

### 3. **/api/todos/[id]**
- **PUT**: Updates a specific todo by its ID.
- **DELETE**: Deletes a specific todo by its ID.

---

## Styling

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and **ShadCN UI** for pre-built UI components.

To customize Tailwind, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file. For ShadCN UI components, refer to the [official documentation](https://shadcn.dev).

---

## Testing

The project uses **Jest** for unit and integration tests. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

You can add additional test files inside the `__tests__` folder.

---

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

You can deploy the application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which provides seamless deployment for Next.js applications. Follow these steps:

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2. Create a Vercel account and link your Git repository.
3. Set up your environment variables in Vercelâ€™s dashboard (Database URL, NextAuth credentials, etc.).
4. Deploy the app with a click.

### Netlify Deployment

Alternatively, you can deploy the app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The steps are similar to Vercel:
1. Connect your Git repository to Netlify.
2. Set up environment variables in the "Build & Deploy" settings.
3. Deploy the app.
